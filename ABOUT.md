Project *Hacker's labyrinth*
================

"Long lost am I in the corridors of this infinite puzzle. Oh how I long to once more be a part of the real world."  -- lost soul

Assume the role of a hacker lost in his own puzzle - an infinite RPG spanning throughout your entire resource stack. Navigate the dark and unbelievable world with creatures of unimaginable power. Fight or hide before them. Find the one sole exit that will lead you back to the real world or become part of the system. Just another computer program that is eventually scheduled for deletion.

I am an aspiring lifelong hacker. Ever since I got my hands on eletronics I was involved in changing the way it works because, well, nothing works the way it's supposed to! From opera songs on Commodore 64 to mechanical devices with Raspberry PI - I liked to get my hands dirty with. My carreer so far however has been mostly business but not much on the not so serious side. 

I see competitions like this as an opportunity to best myself. I want to create a kickass sandbox RPG game both for the amusement of the thoughtful gamer as for my own personal advancement.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

Although I am a Python/Go hacker I shapeshift during the night. I am going to build a rogue-style RPG with a twist - it's going to be an infinite sandbox game. I intend to use Clojure as the main programming language and lots of imagination.
