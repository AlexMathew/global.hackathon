Hello, I am Michael Leng, an aspiring 16 year old high school hacker. I mainly work with web languages, but have dabbled in languages like Java and C++. I enjoy coding for fun, skiing, and gaming. My main role in this competition will be front end development and design, as well as the coordination of the activities of other team members. This is my first hackathon, and I am extremely excited to participate.
